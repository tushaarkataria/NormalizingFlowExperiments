# Git Hub Directory Normalizing Flow Experiments

## To Do
- Code debugging for image data
- Run experiments to analyze effects of different hyperparameters on normalizing flow convergence for image data
- Parameters single normalizing flow or multiple normalizing flows, complexity of the model, number of input samples, activation functions, and others
- Run on application of image superresolution.

# Milestones Achieved

- Code working for 2d Distributions and converging for all 4 distributions
- Run experiments to analyze effects of different hyperparameters on normalizing flow convergence
- Parameters single normalizing flow or multiple normalizing flows, complexity of the model(number of linear layers and dimension of intermediate layers), number of input samples, activation functions, and others
